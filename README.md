# article-social-cataloging
Goodreads/Letterboxd but for online articles.

This website, running at www.chroniclingkane.com allows users to log and review articles that they've read online by submitting a link to the article. Users can also follows other users and see what they've been reading. The website's name is a nod to Citizen Kane (1941). The idea is the users can "chronicle" all the types of journalism that Charles Foster Kane takes part in throughout the film, from anti-corruption campaigning to yellow journalism. Not to mention that a rival paper of Kane's was called "The Chronicle".

Future Improvements:
want to improve the aesthetics of the different pages and give it some of the features that Letterboxd/Goodreads have that make those sites really worthwhile, in my opinion. A few that came to mind:
- get the photos from the articles and save them to an SQL table. This could go a long way towards making the timeline and profile layouts more aesthetic
- implement a "ratings" system
- allow profile pictures
- allow users to like or comment on reviews
- keep track of users' most visited websites and display it somewhere on the profile in the form of a pie chart
- have a "popular articles today" section
- allow users to view other users' profiles
- allow users to store articles in "folders"

so yeah... a lot...

Update 10/6/19: made the homepage a bit nicer. Spoiler alert: it's still pretty ugly. 

Update 10/29/19: really happy with this update. I revamped the entire profile page, including adding a profile picture option which I used Gravatar for. I also added a sidebar with options to view media criticisms for some of media critics who have influenced me mostâ€“Chomsky, Orwell, Parenti, and others. I'm really liking how it looks. Figure I'll easily be able to add a very similar aesthetic to the timeline feature very soon. There are still some small bugs, like you can technically follow the same person unlimited times, but I'm just really pleased to have a revamped homepage. I'll re-comment in the coming days. Probably should've been commenting all along, but hey, I'm still pretty new at this.
