# article-social-cataloging
Goodreads/Letterboxd but for online articles.

This website, running at www.chroniclingkane.com allows users to log and review articles that they've read online by submitting a link to the article. Users can also follows other users and see what they've been reading. The website's name is a nod to Citizen Kane (1941). The idea is the users can "chronicle" all the types of journalism that Charles Foster Kane takes part in throughout the film, from anti-corruption campaigning to yellow journalism. Not to mention that a rival paper of Kane's was called "The Chronicle".

Future Improvements:
want to improve the aesthetics of the different pages and give it some of the features that Letterboxd/Goodreads have that make those sites really worthwhile, in my opinion. A few that came to mind:
- allow users to see who follows them
- get the photos from the articles and save them to an SQL table. This could go a long way towards making the timeline and profile layouts more aesthetic
- implement a "ratings" system
- allow profile pictures
- allow users to like or comment on reviews
- keep track of users' most visited websites and display it somewhere on the profile in the form of a pie chart
- have a "popular articles today" section
- allow users to view other users' profiles
- allow users to store articles in "folders"
so yeah... a lot...
